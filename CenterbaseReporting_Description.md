Primary goal was to design stored procedures that would be used to generate reports to specific client specifications.
- Each report was its own stored procedure, which would pull data based on needed specifications.
- I worked with a small team writing various SPs while senior members worked on another solution.
- Primary languages used were SQL to write the procedures and C# to connect them to the webApp.
